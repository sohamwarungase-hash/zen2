# Frontend

The frontend structure has been updated to improve organization and clarity. Below is the new folder structure:

```
frontend/
├── components/
├── styles/
├── utils/
└── views/
```

- **components/**: Contains reusable components.
- **styles/**: All CSS and styling files are now located here.
- **utils/**: Utility functions used throughout the frontend.
- **views/**: Contains all the main views used in the application.

Please ensure to organize your files accordingly and keep the structure in mind while adding new features or components.
